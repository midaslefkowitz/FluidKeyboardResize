Sample project for my blog post, [Smoothly reacting to keyboard visibility changes](https://saket.me/smoothly-reacting-to-keyboard/).

The implementation for detecting keyboard visibility and animating size change can be found in [FluidContentResizer](https://github.com/saket/FluidKeyboardResize/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/me/saket/fluidresize/sample/FluidContentResizer.kt#L16) and its usage [here](https://github.com/saket/FluidKeyboardResize/blob/0d3c0e878b6652123e2a91e42d6cd4ecc9865b87/sample/src/main/java/me/saket/fluidresize/sample/FluidResizeActivity.kt#L14). It's a tiny project so feel free to simply copy over the necessary files to your project.
